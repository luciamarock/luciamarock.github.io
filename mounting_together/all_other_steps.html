    <h1>Technical Report: From Sensors to the Final Sounding Canvas</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Addition and Testing of Sensors</h2>
        <h3>Initial Setup:</h3>
        <p>Initially, one capacitive sensor was tested using aluminum foil and a resistor to determine proper sensitivity levels. Success with a single sensor led to the addition of three more sensors, resulting in a total of four.</p>

        <h3>Configuration:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Four aluminum foil pads, each connected to an independent "receive" pin on the Arduino (pins 4, 6, 8, and 10), and a shared "send" pin (pin 2).</li>
            <li><strong>Resistors:</strong> Each sensor circuit included a 1.4 MΩ resistor between the send and receive pins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testing:</h3>
        <p>Sensor values were read and calibrated via the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor. Threshold values for activation were determined experimentally to minimize false positives and ensure responsiveness. The system successfully detected individual sensor activation without interference from the others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Fine-Tuning of Resistor Values and Aluminum Foil Dimensions</h2>

        <h3>Resistor Value Optimization:</h3>
        <p>Experimentation revealed that 1.4 MΩ resistors provided the best balance between sensitivity and stability. Lower values caused under-sensitivity, while higher values introduced excessive noise.</p>

        <h3>Aluminum Foil Dimensions:</h3>
        <p>Each sensor was created with an aluminum foil area of approximately <strong>40 square centimeters</strong>. This size offered a reliable detection range for finger touches while avoiding unintentional activation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Mounting Sensors on the Canvas</h2>

        <h3>Placement:</h3>
        <p>Sensors were mounted on the back of the canvas using adhesive to keep them flat and secure. A 3 cm gap was maintained between the canvas and a wooden back panel to accommodate the sensors and other components.</p>

        <h3>Insulation:</h3>
        <p>Non-conductive layers were added between the aluminum foil and the canvas to avoid false triggers caused by external electrical interference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Mounting Other Components</h2>

        <h3>Components Mounted:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arduino Duemilanove:</strong> Connected via USB to the Raspberry Pi for sensor data transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with HiFiBerry Amp2:</strong> Responsible for audio processing and amplification.</li>
            <li><strong>Loudspeakers:</strong> Two 4-inch speakers with 20-40 W power capacity and 4 Ω impedance.</li>
            <li><strong>Cabling:</strong> Managed with clips and supports to ensure a clean and safe layout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Loudspeaker Installation:</h3>
        <p>Speakers were fixed to the wooden back panel using screws and circular recesses to ensure stability and reduce protrusion.</p>

        <h3>Final Assembly:</h3>
        <p>All components were secured to the wooden panel, which was then mounted behind the canvas, ensuring easy access for maintenance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Creation of Sounds</h2>

        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>Sounds were recorded using a sustained electric guitar. Each sensor corresponded to a folder containing four distinct sound samples, creating variety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Python Program for Integration</h2>

        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The Python program executed on the Raspberry Pi serves as the glue for the system, reading sensor data from the Arduino and triggering corresponding audio samples.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Serial Communication:</strong> Reads sensor data from the Arduino over USB.</li>
            <li><strong>Threshold-Based Triggers:</strong> Activates sounds when sensor values exceed predefined thresholds.</li>
            <li><strong>Debouncing:</strong> Ensures a minimum of two seconds between successive activations for each sensor.</li>
            <li><strong>Randomized Sound Selection:</strong> Selects a random sound file from the corresponding folder for variety.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Playback:</strong> Supports simultaneous playback of multiple sounds.</li>
        </ol>
