<p> This page is under construction, however:</p>
<p> The Polyphic Pitch Detection Algorithm for Guitars is something I developed at the time of my collaboration with Benti (a Swizz start-up), since then I have evolved the algorithm but these upgrases are not yet public.</p>
<p> Anyway the first version of the algorithm was based solely upon two techniques: the RTFI and the classic FFT.</p>
<p> I have published separately these two techniques and their implementation is available on my GituHub:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/luciamarock/Polyphonic-Pitch-Detector-for-guitars" target="_blank">RTFI technique</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/luciamarock/FFT_for_RTFI_analyzer" target="_blank">FFT (personal implementation)</a></li>
</ul>
<p> When putting everything together you obtain the algorithm I have developed for Benti (which is not public) at the moment.</p>
<p> You can appreciate the performances of the Benti algorithm in this youtube playlist</p>
