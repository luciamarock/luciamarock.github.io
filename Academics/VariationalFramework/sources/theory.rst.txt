Theoretical Framework
=====================

The SimplesModel is built on the idea that geometry itself can act as an agent
of action and materialization.

A *Simple* is a closed, deformable surface whose behavior is governed entirely
by energetic minimization under strict area conservation.

Key principles:

- Each Simple tends toward a spherical configuration
- Surface area is conserved per Simple
- Interactions occur via shared surface patches
- Local deformations induce global rearrangements
- Evolution is variational, not time-driven

This framework serves as a conceptual bridge between discrete geometric
networks and emergent compositional structures for music and art.
