Overview
========

SimplesModel implements a network of geometric entities called *Simples*,
designed to model energy-driven interactions and surface-mediated dynamics.

This project is part of the Sounding Canvas framework and is based on a
Variational Geometric Network formalized in the following document:

`Compositional Framework PDF <https://github.com/luciamarock/SoundingCanvas/blob/development/documentation/conceptual_framework/compositional_framework_20251120.pdf>`_

The model explores how local deformations propagate through a lattice of
interacting surfaces, producing emergent, path-dependent behavior suitable
for interactive sound and artistic systems.
