                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    We are Dora and Luciano, the collaborative minds behind the <strong>Sounding Canvas</strong> project. Our journey began when we met in Rome in 2013, and we now live and create in Barcelona, Spain.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                    Dora, an Iranian scenographer, graphic designer, and painter, conceived the idea of transforming static paintings into living, interactive beings. She envisioned breaking the traditional "do not touch" rule of art, inviting a deeper, multi-sensory engagement.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                    Luciano, an Italian physicist, sound engineer, and musician, brings the auditory dimension to life. Together, we craft interactive paintings that not only invite touch but respond with sound, fostering a unique dialogue between the artwork and its audience. These canvases can even communicate with each other across the internet, creating a globally connected experience.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The Sounding Canvases are interactive paintings that come alive through touch and respond with sound. Beyond individual interaction, they possess the unique ability to communicate over the internet. This means a touch on a Sounding Canvas in one geographic location (e.g., Spain) can instantly trigger a sonic response on another distant canvas (e.g., the UK), creating a truly global connection.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                    The relationship between your touch and the canvas's sonic response is far from trivial. It's not a simple one-to-one interaction; if you repeatedly touch the same spot, the canvas will not always produce the same sound. This is because each canvas is imbued with an intelligence that tracks the history of gestures, selecting the most appropriate sound to foster a dynamic dialogue with you.
Visually, each canvas is the result of Dora's semiographic research, where she intricately fuses Persian characters with music notation. This artistic fusion serves as a profound metaphor for her life: the Persian characters represent her origins, while the music notation symbolizes her marriage with Luciano. Thus, the visual part is not merely abstract; it's driven by a formal procedure, ultimately constituting a new syntax for a new semantics â€“ the holistic experience of the artwork itself.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    A groundbreaking feature is the ability for multiple Sounding Canvases to be **connected over the internet**. A touch event on one canvas can trigger sound events on peer canvases worldwide.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                    This creates a truly new way for us as humans to be connected across vast distances through touch and sound, fostering a global, shared interactive experience.
