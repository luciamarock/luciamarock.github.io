        <h1>Accrocco Description</h1>

        <p>The <em>Accrocco</em> is a unique wooden sculpture created in 2015, designed as an experimental musical instrument. Its structure and functionality combine acoustic principles with artistic creativity, resulting in a versatile and intriguing sound source.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Materials:</strong> The sculpture is primarily constructed from wood and plastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Design:</strong> Two large wooden panels are held together by two rectangular wooden poles, forming a stable framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> A flexible plastic strip is mounted between the two poles in a V-shaped configuration. This plastic strip serves as the bridge where the strings are attached on one side.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Strings and Vibrations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <em>Accrocco</em> features three strings stretched across the structure.</li>
            <li>A pickup is mounted to capture the vibrations of the strings, allowing their sound to be amplified or processed.</li>
            <li>The flexibility of the plastic strip creates a dynamic interaction with the strings. When plucked, the strings' vibrations cause the bridge to bend, producing a momentary fluctuation in their frequency. This adds a unique modulation effect to the sound, making the instrument capable of generating complex and evolving tones.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sound Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The combination of string vibrations and the bending bridge introduces rich, unpredictable harmonic textures. The resulting sounds are both organic and mechanically intriguing, offering a wide spectrum of sonic possibilities.</p>
