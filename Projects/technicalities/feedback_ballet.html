    <h1>FeedBack Ballet</h1>
    <p>
        The Feedback Ballet is a performance piece built around the dynamic interaction between a dancer (Anna Manes), a unique interactive stage element called the 
        <a href="https://luciamarock.github.io/Projects/AccroccoSonic.html" target="_blank">Accrocco</a>, and an augmented guitar called the 
        <a href="https://luciamarock.github.io/Projects/FeedGuitar.html" target="_blank">Feed-Guitar</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A real-time feedback loop between performer, Accrocco, and Feed-Guitar forms the core of the performance:
    </p>
    <h2>The Accrocco</h2>
    <p>
        This element serves as the intermediary, translating the dancer's movements into control signals that directly affect the Feed-Guitar's sound. It is equipped with strings, sensors, and a learning algorithm. The dancer's interaction with the Accrocco, primarily through manipulating its strings, generates a signal. This signal is processed by the Accrocco's algorithm, which then sends an analog signal to the Feed-Guitar. This analog signal physically alters the vibrations of the Feed-Guitar's strings, directly modifying its sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        This process creates a continuous feedback loop:
    </p>
    <p><b>Dancer's movement → Accrocco → Feed-Guitar sound change → Dancer’s reaction to the new sound → Accrocco → etc.</b></p>
    <p>
        While the feedback loop inherently introduces an element of unpredictability, the algorithms within the Accrocco, combined with the composer's oversight, ensure that the feedback remains within defined artistic boundaries.
    </p>
    <h2>The Feed-Guitar</h2>
    <p>
        This is not a traditional instrument. It is augmented with technology that allows external signals from the Accrocco to directly influence its sound production. Critically, the Accrocco's signal directly manipulates the strings of the Feed-Guitar, resulting in tangible timbre shifts. This direct manipulation is a crucial aspect of the performance, creating an immediate and perceptible connection between the dancer’s movement and the sonic output.
    </p>
    <p>The Feed-Guitar's sound is 30% driven by the Accrocco's signals; the remaining 70% of its sonic output comes from the musician playing the instrument.</p>
    <h2>The Dancer (Anna Manes)</h2>
    <p>
        Anna Manes is not simply performing a pre-choreographed routine. She actively interacts with the Accrocco, directly influencing the music in real-time. Her movements are both the cause and the effect within the feedback loop. She reacts to the changing music, which, in turn, causes further changes in the music. This creates a dynamic and responsive performance.
    </p>
    <h2>Scenography (Dora Motèque)</h2>
    <p>
        The Accrocco is not merely a technical device; it has been designed as a work of art by scenographer and visual artist <a href="https://doramoteque-faf94c.webflow.io/" target="_blank">Dora Motèque</a>. This artistic integration emphasizes the importance of the visual and aesthetic dimensions of the performance, ensuring that the Accrocco is not just functional but also visually compelling.

            Testing the interaction between Accrocco and Feed-Guitar, particularly vibrating the Feed-Guitar with the sound produced by the Accrocco:
