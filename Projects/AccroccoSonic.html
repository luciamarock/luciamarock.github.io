        <h1>Accrocco Description</h1>

        <p>The <em>Accrocco</em> is a unique wooden sculpture created in 2015, designed as an experimental musical instrument. Its structure and functionality combine acoustic principles with artistic creativity, resulting in a versatile and intriguing sound source.</p>

    </figure>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Materials:</strong> The sculpture is primarily constructed from wood and plastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Design:</strong> Two large wooden panels are held together by two rectangular wooden poles, forming a stable framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> A flexible plastic strip is mounted between the two poles in a V-shaped configuration. This plastic strip serves as the bridge where the strings are attached on one side.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Strings and Vibrations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <em>Accrocco</em> features three strings stretched across the structure.</li>
            <li>A pickup is mounted to capture the vibrations of the strings, allowing their sound to be amplified or processed.</li>
            <li>The flexibility of the plastic strip creates a dynamic interaction with the strings. When plucked, the strings' vibrations cause the bridge to bend, producing a momentary fluctuation in their frequency. This adds a unique modulation effect to the sound, making the instrument capable of generating complex and evolving tones.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sound Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The combination of string vibrations and the bending bridge introduces rich, unpredictable harmonic textures. The resulting sounds are both organic and mechanically intriguing, offering a wide spectrum of sonic possibilities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
  <h1>AccroccoSonic Project</h1>
  <p>The <strong>AccroccoSonic</strong> project combines art, engineering, and music to create an innovative and interactive sound sculpture. Building on the unique design of the original <em>Accrocco</em> sculpture, which features strings mounted on a flexible plastic bridge to generate intriguing vibrations, this project aims to enhance its sonic capabilities through advanced technology.</p>
  <p>The goal of AccroccoSonic is to transform the Accrocco into an active sound instrument capable of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Processing its pickup signal using spectral manipulation techniques (FFT and IFFT).</li>
    <li>Amplifying and reinjecting the processed signal into the structure using actuators to produce rich, evolving soundscapes.</li>
    <li>Project the Sound onto one Sounding Canvas.</li>
    <li>Creating a self-contained system powered by a Raspberry Pi and HiFiBerry Amp 2, ensuring portability and ease of use.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We already used the Accrocco in the past to create a unique performance that we called <a href="https://luciamarock.github.io/Projects/technicalities/feedback_ballet.html" target="_blank">FeedBack Ballet.</a> We strongly suggest you to check it out !</p>
